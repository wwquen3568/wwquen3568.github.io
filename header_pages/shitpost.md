What is shitpost?

For the blind, it is the vision.
For the hungry, it is the feast.
For the thirsty, it is the water.

If it shows, I see.
If it speaks, I listen.
If it thinks, I agree.

If it has millions of fans, I'm one of them.
If it has thousands of fans, I'm one of them.
If it has hundreads of fans, I'm one of them.
If it has tens of fans, I'm one of them.
If it has only one fan, I'm one of them.
If it has no fans, I no longer exist.

Shitpost, my light.
Shitpost, my darkness.
Shitpost, my angel.
Shitpost, my devil.
Shitpost, my guidance.
Shitpost, my chaos.
Shitpost, my comedy.
Shitpost, my tragedy.
Shitpost, my love.
Shitpost, my hatred.
Shitpost, my sanctuary.
Shitpost, my soul.

Shitpost.
Me.
